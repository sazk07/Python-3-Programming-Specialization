# # The Project #
# 1. This is a project with minimal scaffolding. Expect to use the the discussion forums
# to gain insights! Itâ€™s not cheating to ask others for opinions or perspectives!
# 2. Be inquisitive, try out new things.
# 3. Use the previous modules for insights into how to complete the functions! You'll have
# to combine Pillow, OpenCV, and Pytesseract
# 4. There are hints provided in Coursera, feel free to explore the hints if needed. Each
# hint provide progressively more details on how to solve the issue. This project is intended
# to be comprehensive and difficult if you do it without the hints.
# ### The Assignment ###
# Take a [ZIP file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) of images and process
# them, using a [library built into python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html)
# that you need to learn how to use. A ZIP file takes several different files and compresses
# them, thus saving space, into one single file. The files in the ZIP file we provide are
# newspaper images (like you saw in week 3). Your task is to write python code which allows
# one to search through the images looking for the occurrences of keywords and faces. E.g. if
# you search for "pizza" it will return a contact sheet of all of the faces which were
# located on the newspaper page which mentions "pizza". This will test your ability to learn
# a new ([library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html)), your ability to use
# OpenCV to detect faces, your ability to use tesseract to do optical character recognition,
# and your ability to use PIL to composite images together into contact sheets.
# Each page of the newspapers is saved as a single PNG image in a file
# called [images.zip](./readonly/images.zip). These newspapers are in english, and contain
# a variety of stories, advertisements and images. Note: This file is fairly large (~200 MB)
# and may take some time to work with, I would encourage you to use
# [small_img.zip](./readonly/small_img.zip) for testing.
# Here's an example of the output expected. Using the [small_img.zip](./readonly/small_img.zip)
# file, if I search for the string "Christopher" I should see the following image:
# ![Christopher Search](./readonly/small_project.png)
# If I were to use the [images.zip](./readonly/images.zip) file and search for "Mark" I should
# see the following image (note that there are times when there are no faces on a page,
# but a word is found!):
# ![Mark Search](./readonly/large_project.png)
# Note: That big file can take some time to process - for me it took nearly ten minutes!
# Use the small one for testing.
